# Lung_Nodule_Segmentation_Project
 The code of the lung nodule segmentation project. (My MSc individual project) 

## Data preprocessing

- Add a dataset shortcut to your google drive from http://medicaldecathlon.com/  (Task06_Lung.tar) 
- Follow the data preprocessing steps in the data preprocessing.ipython file. 

## Get started

- Welcome to download my pretrained weights here! [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UZShlLmtEcs0oFUIkw-MjOCFvurKcqrV?usp=sharing) 
- Run the NSTAU network (or whichever network you want :D)
- The user may take a look at the attention unet in advance to understand the attention gate. 
- The user is also recommended to run the vision transformer tutorial provided by TensorFlow to gain more understanding of the vision transformer.  

## Project Environment

The entire project is conducted in the Google Colab. The key library version when I am doing the project is listed below. 

- Python version = 3.7.13 
- TensorFlow version = 2.8.2 
- Keras version = 2.8.0 
- Tensorflow-addons = 0.17.1.
